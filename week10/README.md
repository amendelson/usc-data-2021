### Quick hands-on

**1. Bring in census data, tidily and easily**

There's a great R package for importing census data. Let's install and load it.

```
install.packages("leaflet")
library(leaflet)
library(tidyverse)
```

```
install.packages("tidycensus")
library(tidycensus)
```

To get the data from the Census' API, you need to provide an API Key. Find yours and use it.

```
census_api_key("TK", overwrite = FALSE, install = FALSE)
```

Once you've done that, you can quickly grab data. If you want to know the median age by state in 2010 ... now you can.

```
age10 <- get_decennial(geography = "state",
                       variables = "P013001",
                       year = 2010)

head(age10)
```

It can also easily be plotted.

```
age10 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = reorder(NAME, value))) +
  geom_point()
```

We can use this package to grab data from the more-frequently-updated American Community Survey. It's like a rolling Census that's being conducted all the time.

Let's look at public transit.

```
transpo <- get_acs(geography = "state", variables = "B08006_008", geometry = FALSE, survey = "acs5", year = 2017)
```

```
head(transpo)
```

Interesting. But what we really want is the **rate** of transit riders. Not the raw number. So let's get that, starting with the total number of folks who commute to work.

```
transpo_total <- get_acs(geography = "state", variables = "B08006_001", geometry = FALSE, survey = "acs5", year = 2017)
head(transpo_total)

```

Alright, now we need to get these ... together in the same data frame! That's where the `join` comes in. We did some of these in QGIS. What could we use in these two datasets to link them up?

**2. A detour into joins**

All you need to join is a common column. Here's how it works in tidyverse.

```
transpo <- transpo %>% left_join(transpo_total, by = "NAME")
```

Now we can get the rate.

```
transpo$rate <- transpo$estimate.x / transpo$estimate.y * 100
head(transpo)
```

**3. Map out (after another join)**

We need to join that transportation data to our shapefile. Unfortunately, the syntax there is a little different. Fortunately, it does work.

For this, we'll need to bring back the states shapefile we used last week.

You'll need to re-upload the zip file.

```
library(rgdal)
states <- readOGR("/cloud/project",
                  layer = "tl_2019_us_state", GDAL1_integer64_policy = TRUE)
```

Then we can do a join.

```
states_with_rate <- sp::merge(states, transpo, by = "NAME")
```

Let's try this out.

```
qpal <- colorQuantile("PiYG", states_with_rate$rate, 9)


states_with_rate %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(weight = 1, smoothFactor = 0.5, opacity = 1.0, fillOpacity = 0.5,
    color = ~qpal(rate),
    highlightOptions = highlightOptions(color = "white", weight = 2,
      bringToFront = TRUE))
```

Alright. What does each line do? Let's play around with it and see what changes?

If we have extra time, we'll work on adding [popup text](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/popups.html) and [a legend](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/legends.html).

### Homework

* HW: Finish coding if we didn't in class.
* Final Project: Your data analysis should almost done. You should be reporting and writing as you go.
* Story memo: 50-100 words about Final Project progress over last week
* [Download the latest "stable" version of QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html), likely 3.10
