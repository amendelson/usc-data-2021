### Hands-on

**1. Get some data**

Let's grab data on shootings involving L.A. County Sheriff's deputies [here](https://data.lacounty.gov/Criminal/All-Shooting-Incidents-for-Deputy-Involved-Shootin/d5zc-33fr).

Let's open and explore in Excel. You'll notice that this does have lat/lon. That'll come in handy when we want to see how accurate our geocodes are.

**2. Learn about geocoding in QGIS**

There are a couple options [for how to do that](http://duspviz.mit.edu/tutorials/geocoding/).

**3. Check out how the free version of a paid service works**

Point your browser [here](https://www.geocod.io/)

**4. Open file up in QGIS**

I suggest EPSG 4269: NAD 83 as the CRS

**5. Also open up the original file in QGIS**

Do they match?

**6. Let's do some reporting**

And figure out how many of these shootings happen in census tracts with below average incomes.

Start by firing up R. Begin with this:

```
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)

la <- get_acs(state = "CA", county = "Los Angeles", geography = "tract", variables = "B19013_001", geometry = TRUE)
```

What'd we do there?

This isn't really necessary, but it's nice to see how simple it is to map it in R.

```
la %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = estimate)) + 
  geom_sf(color = NA) + 
  coord_sf(crs = 26911) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma") 
```

**7. Compare to median household income**

Let's get the median household income for the county as a whole.

```
la_median <- get_acs(state = "CA", county = "Los Angeles", geography = "county", variables = "B19013_001", geometry = FALSE)
```


Alright here's the big comparison. Let's use case_when.

```
la$median <- case_when(
    la$estimate >= la_median$estimate ~ "above median", 
    TRUE ~ "below median")
```
And let's check how many tracts are below the median income.

```
la %>% group_by(median) %>% tally()
```

**8. Export that data**

I'm putting mine in my Downloads folder, you'll want to adjust accordingly.

```
install.packages("sf")
library(sf)
st_write(la, "~/Downloads/la.shp")
```

**9. Count points in polygon**

Add the shapefile.

Then, let's try this.

<img src ="imgs/points-in-poly.png" width = "600">

Pretty strightforward. Now, let's open the attribute table and see what it did.

We can highlight the highest counts, by selecting those rows.

**10. Let's figure out if most shootings happen in above or below median income tracts.**

How do we do that? You tell me.

### Links

Geocoding services

* [US Census](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/): Free! But not the most accurate option. US addresses only.
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start): Very accurate (but not perfect). 2,500 free geocodes per day. Pay beyond that. API Key required
* [Geocodio](https://www.geocod.io/): API or upload. Fast, relatively cheap, accurate.

### Homework

* Mapping Assignment 3: I want you to map a dataset related to your Final Project or capstone. Every group member needs to make their own map.
* Story memo: 50-100 words about Final Project progress over last week
